I added the wireframes because I forgot to add the screenshot of it that was created using canva.
Ive added the sitemap which was also created on canva.
Ive added my second proposal to the wrod document


This repository contains the development of a proposed website for the Roodepoort SPCA.
The site is designed to raise awareness about animal welfare, promote pet adoption, collect donations, and recruit volunteers in the local community.
